# squatter_scan
Squatter Scan is an advanced domain squatting and typo-squatting detection tool built for cybersecurity professionals, red teamers, and threat hunters. It takes in a list of domains and outputs typosquatted variations, checks if they are registered, evaluates their infrastructure, and flags potential threatsâ€”all with a single command.
